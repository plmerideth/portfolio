          <h3 class="readingCategory">JavaScript: Novice to Ninja</h3>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>CHAPTER 9 - THE WINDOW OBJECT</strong></li>
            <p>- The keyword 'this' can be used in the global space to select the global object</p>
            <p>- Global variables are created without using const let or var</p>
            <p>- You should avoid referencing global variable with window, such as, window.myVariable. This makes code more portable between environments</p>
            <p>- alert() always returns undefined.  confirm() returns a boolean, true or false, depending on user response.  prompt() returns the string the user entered</p>
            <p>- location property of window contains info about the current URL.  ie. windows.location.href = full URL as a string</p>
            <li> Window methods include:</li>
            <p>- .navigator.userAgent=broswer; location.href=full URL; location.protocol=protocol used; location.host=domain of current URL; location.hostname=domain name; location.port=port being used; location.pathname=path that follows domain; location.search=string starting with ? followed by query parameters; location.assign()=loads another resource from URL</p>
            <p>- window.history shows browser history info; window.open()= opens a new window; window.resizeTo()= resizes window; window.screen.height, window.screen.width = height and width</p>
            <li> To see example of cookie use, visit a website, open console, and type document.cookie.</li>
            <li> window.setTimeout() accepts a callback and number of ms to wait before calling. It returns an integer used as an ID for the timeout.</li>
            <li> window.setInterval() accepts a callback and a value x in MS and will repeatedly invoke the callback every x MS.  Use window.clearInterval(ID) to clear it</li>
            <li> In general, it's better to use CSS for animation than window animation methods.</li>
            <li><strong>CHAPTER 14 - HTML5 APIs</strong></li>
            <li>HTML 5 added many new features, including:</li>
            <p> - The data-attribute, local storage, geolocation, web workers, multimedia, canvas shapes, shims, and polyfills</p>
            <li>The site caniuse.com checks to see if a specific feature can be used</li>
            <li>The data-attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that the browser ignores.  They're sole purpose is to be used by Javascript programs.</li>
            <li>data-attributes are accessed using the dataset property or the .getAttribute() method.</li>
            <p>- For a data attribute named data-super-powers, access it as dataset.superPowers (use camel case notation to replace dashes), or superman.getAttribute('super-powers');</p>
            <li>The web storage API provides the localStorage functionality</li>
            <li>The geoLocation API provides functions to return the location and speed of the device (if location allowed)</li>
            <li>Web Workers allow javascript processes to be run in the background and interprocess communication between the running threads.  It uses the postMessage() method to send messages.</li>
            <li>Shared Web Workers can be used by multiple scripts</li>
            <li>Service Workers allow a worker script to intercept network requests.</li>
            <li>Websockets are a new protocol that allows two-way communication with a server.  A connection is opened and stays open and responses are pushed to the client from the server over the connection.</li>
            <li>The notification API allows showing messages using the system's notifications.</li>
            <li>Multimedia is supported using audio and video tags.  Any content between the tags will only display if the browser doesn't support the tag.</li>
            <li>The audio and video tags have Javascript methods to control them.  play(), pause(), volume(), etc.</li>
            <li>The canvas API was also introduced.  See previous week's notes for more details</li>
          </ul>
